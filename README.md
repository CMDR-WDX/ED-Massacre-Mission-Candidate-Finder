A small tool that consumes a JSON of all inhabited systems (get an updated one from spansh.co.uk) and returns systems which match criteria for Massacre Missions.

This will find systems with 1 Anarchy Faction with as few other anarchy factions as possible in a System with Rings with as many factions / systems as possible in a 10ly radius.
